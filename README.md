# [diff.haus](https://diff.haus)

Diff Haus is a simple way to share diffs with people. You can post a diff to an API endpoint, then share a link with anyone who might want to see your changed files.

This is currently an experimental but fully functional app! With that said, the backing Supabase instance may have gone to sleep, so your mileage may vary when testing it out. If this is a project/product you want to use, please [file an issue](https://github.com/flatpickles/diff.haus/issues/new) and I'll get it back up and running.
